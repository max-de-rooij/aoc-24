# 2024 Advent of Code
Julia solutions I produced for the 2024 Advent of Code [^aoc]. 

## Repository Structure
Solutions are included in `src` and are labelled `day-x.jl`, for the solution of day `x`.

## Input Files
In accordance with the rules set in the Advent of Code, the inputs are _not_ shared. Inputs are assumed to be in the `inputs` directory and are structured as `day-x.txt`, for the solution of day `x`.

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] – An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
